# Errors

# Syntax(grammar) Error: happens when Python cannot interpret your code, since we didn't follow the correct syntax for
# Python. These errors you're likely to get when you make a typo.
# (red underline) - (compile-time)

# Exceptions (crash): happens when unexpected things happen during the execution of a program (run-time), even if
# the code is syntactically correct. There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python, and you can see
# which exception is 'thrown' in the error message.
# -> please "read the error message!"
